Calculating Memory Requirements Calculating Memory Requirements

I have a data frame with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all of which are numeric data. Roughly,
how much memory is required to store this data frame?
1,500,000 × 120 × 8 bytes/numeric
= 1440000000 bytes
= 1440000000 / bytes/MB
= 1,373.29 MB
= 1.34 GB
